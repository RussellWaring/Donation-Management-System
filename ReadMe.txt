## Donation Management System
This task of this project began with simulating the collaboration with a project sponsor. Our team engaged in real conversations with the project sponsor to understand the limited as-is system, gathering requirements and analyzing the scope of the project to-be.

We generated documentation including a data flow diagram, system boundary diagram, entity-relationship diagrams, a normalization diagram, and more. We also created a data dictionary and used this to inform the development of our database. Additionally, we developed stored procedures and triggers for working with our database.

We tied this together by creating a WPF desktop application using Visual Studio Enterprise. The project featured live queries and CRUD functionality, user data, and data visualizations which were programmatically generated.
